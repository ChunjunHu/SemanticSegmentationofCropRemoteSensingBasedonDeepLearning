# SemanticSegmentationofCropRemoteSensingBasedonDeepLearning
DeepLabv3+; Pytorch; Remote Sensing Image; Semantic Segmentation

Use the DeepLabV3+ network to perform semantic segmentation on crop remote sensing images. The model can segment different types of crops and man-made buildings, and realize end-to-end pixel-level semantic segmentation, with a final accuracy of 78.66%.
